presenting a solution on how to increase the number of registered voters
Slide 1: - 
Good morning/Afternoon Everyone presents here, I am Harsh Jain and this is Team Gravity presenting a solution on how to increase the number of registered voters.
 
Problems are: - 

•The process of applying for voter ID is tough as well as lengthy. 
There is nothing so much interesting about voting.
•Lack of awareness about voting 
•And what is the necessity to vote
•To verify these statements we did enough research, with a conclusion that this problem is true


These problems are also faced by 
Migrants, shopkeepers, students, and housewives.
 
•	And This has been verified by an article released by “The Times of India”.
•	Stating that the 
•	As many as 91% of urban migrants are not registered to vote
•	But the process is painful, particularly if you are not from the same state.
•	language is a barrier.

        But the interesting part is, people want to vote.

if we talk about the present scenario of the migrant voting system:-
ECI has launched a Remote Voting machine to let migrants vote separately.

They have the facility to transfer their voter id card from one place to other.

also, they can use their rental address proof to apply for a voter id card as a migrant.

But still, people don’t prefer to take part in the Indian election system.

To come up with this problem we are designing a 



A website that can be a voter’s Guide
We have designed the website as aapka adhikar, where we support, promote, and relay information about voting and voting criteria. 

The website tells an individual that
why voting is important, and how every fair vote matters in the election system.
The website also consists of a voter Id registration form.

People say the form is very lengthy and tough to fill.

To solve this problem we have added a data backup system in which the website saves the half-fill form so that the users can continue filling the form once again from where they left off last time.

 
To cheer up Indian citizens about voting we have used foreign election data, which informs how a large amount of urban-rural and migrants vote together for a leader, and how beneficial it becomes for them, by choosing a correct leader or choosing with NOTA.

 To make the website more interesting and public we have introduced a virtual voting system, where people like migrants, and housewives can try voting. 
This will give them a feel of how interesting the voting system can be when we see our choice once, winning.

 
Don’t you feel people will be more interested if someone asks them what they expect from the government?
to come up with this we have designed a portal where people can raise a query, about issues they face during registration, and can also share their thoughts on what they want from govt., this will take the website to try every individual because every citizen wants to raise voice about their needs and requirements.

Apart from this, there are major steps that can be taken by the ECI that can help them register migrants with more ease.


ECI can collaborate with Private companies for verification purposes, a company holds a large amount of data on their employees.

 which can be used for verification purposes.
Once verified, the ECI can release temporary voter id cards for migrant voters that automatically dissolve once the elections are over.
In this way, the issue of shifting the migrant voter ID card can be neglected.

 
Same way ECI can also collaborate with colleges where groups like NSS can help ECI promoting people to register for voter id cards.
informing about the govt. websites, and the process of registration.

 
Now, let's take a look at how our website can be improved over time:-

Before looking at the future update, first, let's take a look at what are we getting from the website.
So the website gives us DATA.
This data can be consistently used to automate websites by the time

With this data, the website can be trained for Fraud detection
Artifical intelligence-bas Aadhar and pan verification.

Multidivision database system, where the website maintains the data of migrants and locals separately.

And a Self-learning AI can be deployed that can learn to guide the new registering person.

I hope till now I made clear what problem we are solving and how will it ease the process of ECI.

But the question is, in the field of Virtual reality, blockchain, and cloud computing why do we promote a simple website?

, the answer is clear using a website is very easy to handle, can be updated from time to time, has a low maintenance cost,
Easy to share among large groups of people and if required it can be easily compiled with the ECI present websites.
